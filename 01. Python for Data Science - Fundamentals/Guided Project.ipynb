    "While we have identified the duplicates based on the App name, we need to decide which of those duplicate records should be retained for each App.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Google dataset, this could be done based on the following data points in each record:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of Reviews**: The record having the most number of reviews among the duplicates, can be considered the one that has the latest data. Hence, that record can be retained while the remaining duplicates deleted.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. **Last Updated Date**: The record with the latest value for the Last Updated Date can be considered the latest record to be retained while the others get deleted.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. **Version Number**: The record with the highest version number for the app can be considered the latest record to be retained while th others get deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Removing the Duplicates\n",
    "To remove the duplicates, we will have to build logic to identify the records that will need to be retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic is implemented within the `dedup_float` method. The name suggests that this method handles deduplication of records based on a float value comparison between records. This method can be used to de-duplicate the records based on the values in any column that contains a float value. This can be used to deduplicate based on the number of reviews for each app. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the logic is to avoid multiple iterations through the large data-set. The idea is to not only identify the records that should be retained or discarded, but also to collect the records to be retained into a list during the same iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we use two dictionaries. The first dictionary `max_values` will store the maximum value of reviews for each record. The second dictionary `deduped_records` is used to hold the deduped records.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we iterate through the dataset, we compare the reviews value for each app with the value stored in the `max_values` dictionary. If no value is found in that dictionary, or if there exists a value but it is lesser than the current value, then the values in both dictionaries are replaced with the values from the current record."
